- Prevents duplicate votes from the same user
- Provides immediate UI feedback for vote actions
- Stores vote counts directly on startup documents for efficient querying
- Tracks individual votes for user analytics

### Authentication Flow

User authentication is handled through:
- GitHub OAuth integration via NextAuth.js
- Automatic profile creation in Sanity upon first login
- Session management for secure access to protected features
